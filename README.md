**KEY INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Profitability Optimization**

1	The hospital has a 30.8% profit margin, which is decent, but there is room for improvement.

2	Reducing operational costs, negotiating better supply chain deals, and enhancing service efficiency could improve profitability.

 **Addressing Patient Visit Decline**
 
•	Patient visits dropped significantly in 2023. Possible reasons: 

o	Competition from other hospitals.

o	Higher service costs leading to affordability issues.

o	Changes in hospital policies affecting patient retention.

**Recommendation: **

 **Focus on High-Performing Specialties**
   
1	Dermatology and Cardiology generate the most revenue; investment in these departments (staff, equipment) can drive more profits.

2	Pediatrics and Ophthalmology are underperforming in revenue compared to patient numbers. Strategies like upselling complementary procedures (e.g., check-ups + vaccinations) can help.

 Leverage High-Performing Doctors
   
1	Ava Adams and Liam Turner are top performers.

2	Incentivizing them (bonuses, better working conditions) can increase their productivity and retain them.

** Improve Doctor-Patient Ratio**

1	The hospital currently has more doctors than patients in this dataset.

2	This imbalance could indicate underutilized medical staff, leading to inefficiencies.

Recommendation:
